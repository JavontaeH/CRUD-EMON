# CRUD-EMON

## Description

CRUD-EMON is a react app where users can create, read, update, and delete Pokemon and then actually battle with the pokemon that they created!

### Additional Info

CRUD-EMON is a React app that I created for my front-end capstone project at NSS, I believe it encapsulates everything I've learned over the 3 month period and my ability to learn outside of the course requirements. It is a relatively simple tech stack using only React/CSS with almost no library usage outside of the animation (gsap) and sound (howler) engines. The goal for this project was to create a CRUD app using React, but I wanted to take it a step farther by allowing users to do something cool with what they created. So I ended up with this Pokemon app that allows users to create pokemon and then battle with them, the actual game itself is more of a demo as there could be more features added, i.e. type advantage and more pokemon stats, but I'm proud of this version as it stands.
